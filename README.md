# Flashcardsv1

This is a python flashcard program that contains all of the following:
20+ flashcards. Each card has:
a text prompt that will be displayed to the user
a correct answer that can by typed in
Show the flashcards in a random order
get user's response
check if the response is correct
Use file I/O to keep track of user performance, e.g.
How many questions did the user get right vs wrong
Which questions did the user get right vs wrong
Use the user input data (performance or other text input) to change the way you show the flashcards, e.g.
Show flashcards that a user got wrong more frequently than the ones they got right
Stop showing a flashcard once the user gets it right a certain number of times
Implement the The Leitner System
Let the user answer questions about how many flashcards they want to see, or which flashcards they want to see more frequently

Have an option to display statistics on user performance.
Allow a user to "login" with a specific username, so different people can use your system and keep track of their results separately.
** Can be displayed in a web browser at https://replit.com/@NoahPotischman/Flashcardsv1 ** , or can be displayed locally with flask.
